This is a directory in which I will collect all my Stardew Valley related .ahk scripts (which at the moment is only one).

The "animation cancel.ahk" script provides the following functionality:
- Animation cancelling on press of space bar
- Activation/deactivation of the animation cancelling functionality via F5
- Mapping arrow keys to wasd
- Mapping SC029 to ctrl+tab (which rotates the inventory/hotbar backwards)
	On a german keyboard layout (DIN 2137-2) this is the ^/Â° key that is located directly above the tab key, `/~ on us keyboards (ANSI).
	The key can be changed by editing the .ahk file to whatever else you like. SC029 is a key in the scancode format so you might want to look that up.
