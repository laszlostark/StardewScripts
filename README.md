This is a directory in which I will collect all my Stardew Valley related .ahk scripts (which at the moment is only one).

The "animation cancel.ahk" script provides the following functionality:
- Animation cancelling on press of space bar
- Activation/deactivation of the script via F5
- Mapping arrow keys to wasd
- Mapping SC029 to ctrl+tab (which rotates the inventory/hotbar backwards)
	On my german keyboard layout this is the ^/Â° key that is located directly above the tab key, though you mileage may vary.
	The key can be changed by editing the .ahk file to whatever else you like. SC029 is a key in the scancode format so you might want to look that up.
